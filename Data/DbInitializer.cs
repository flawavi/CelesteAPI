The Moon is approximately 27% the volume of Earth, with a radius of about 1,080 miles, but because it is relatively close to Earth, with an average distance of 240,000 miles, the effects of the Moon's gravity on Earth are pronounced. Interestingly, the rest of the planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and Uranus) would all fit snugly between the Moon and Earth at that distance.
                      The Moon is about 4.5B years old, and it has been orbiting the Earth for so long that it has become tidally locked to Earth. The Moon revolves around the Earth every 27 days, and it takes the same amount of time for the Moon to revolve on its own axis. This is the principle reason why we only ever see one side of the Moon.
